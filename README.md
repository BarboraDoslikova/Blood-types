# Blood-types
Your child's blood type predictor

This is my first web page where I practise some of the concepts I am learning.

Eventually, I want this web page to demonstrate the following:
- browser compatibility
- responsive design
- progressive enhancement
- graceful degradation
- accessibility
- good UX
- interesting web design

I want to use:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
